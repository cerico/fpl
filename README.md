# FPL Marginal Prices Firefox Extension

## TLDR

FPL Marginal Prices is a Firefox browser extension that adjusts player prices on the Fantasy Premier League website. It shows each players price relative to the cheapest possible player in their position.

## Description

To understand a player's relative value in FPL, the extension adjusts their price based on the cost of the cheapest defender in the game. For instance, if Ben Chilwell's current FPL price is 5.5m and the cheapest defender is priced at 4.0m, Chilwell's adjusted price becomes 1.5m. Should there be an overnight price drop, making the cheapest defender 3.9m, Chilwell's adjusted price would then be 1.6m.

## Explanation

Think of the cheapest defender's price as the "baseline cost" or "fixed cost" for acquiring any defender. The difference between this baseline and a player's actual price is the "marginal cost" â€“ the extra amount you'd spend to acquire a premium player over the most affordable option.

For example:

Ben Chilwell's actual FPL price: 5.5m.
Baseline cost (cheapest defender): 4.0m.
Marginal cost for Chilwell: 1.5m (5.5m - 4.0m).
If the baseline drops to 3.9m (due to a price decrease for the cheapest defender), the marginal cost for Chilwell becomes 1.6m (5.5m - 3.9m).

This method highlights the additional amount you're investing in Chilwell over the base option. It offers a more transparent view of players' relative values, especially when weighing premium players against budget choices.
